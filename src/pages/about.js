        The Yale Economic Review (YER), established in 2005, is a non-profit,
        bi-annual journal of popular economics which reports on developments in
        economics to a broad audience. YER is not a peer-reviewed academic
        journal; rather, it aims to fill the gap between the technical content
        in traditional academic journals and the sporadic coverage of economics
        in the popular press. YER is distributed to students and faculty at
        business schools, law schools, policy schools, and economics departments
        in the United States, as well as to a segment of a general audience. The
        journal is edited and managed by students from Yale College, who are
        advised by distinguished Professors in Yaleâ€™s Department of Economics
        and at the Yale School of Management.

        Issues often include articles by academic economists and industry
        practitioners who want to reach a broader audience than academic
        journals could provide. YER also synopsizes current economic research
        and reviews books, besides offering other articles on pressing academic
        matters. Additionally, YER carries interviews with leaders in finance,
        industry, public policy and academia. Recent interviewees include Nobel
        Laureates Robert Shiller, Paul Samuelson and George Akerlof, CEOs John
        Thain of the New York Stock Exchange and James P. Gorman of Morgan
        Stanley, Pulitzer Prize-winning author and energy expert Daniel Yergin
        of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, celebrity political and
        economic commentator Ben Stein, and UN Millennium Project Director
        Jeffrey Sachs of Columbia University.

        2020 as a platform for discussion, opinion, and excellent undergraduate
        writing on economic topics.
